-- Sigma → Snowflake cost attribution (standalone / Cortex Code friendly).
-- Runs natively in a Snowflake worksheet or Cortex Code — no external CLI needed.
-- Attributes attributed compute credits to the Sigma object that issued each query.

-- Edit the three SET vars, run, then either read the result table or export it as JSON
-- and render with:  analyze.py --from-rows result.json --goal both
