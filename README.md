# Sigma Performance & Cost Advisor

Find the Sigma workloads driving Snowflake cost, measure whether existing
materializations are actually serving reads, and recommend the least expensive option
that still meets latency and freshness goals. Analysis is read-only; remediation is
explicit and opt-in.

It answers: *"How do we keep Sigma fast while spending less—and which materializations
should we keep, retune, investigate, remove, or add?"*

> Works as a [Claude Code / Agent skill](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)
> (via `SKILL.md`) **and** as a standalone CLI (Python 3 stdlib + the `snow` CLI). The
> cost-analysis SQL also runs natively in **Snowflake / Cortex Code** — see below.

## How it works

Sigma stamps every warehouse query's `QUERY_TAG` with `Sigma Σ {sourceUrl, email, kind}`.
The advisor joins that metadata to:

- `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` for real per-query compute credits;
- `ACCESS_HISTORY` to match materialization-created objects to subsequent reads;
- `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` for warehouse idle context; and
- Sigma schedules, elements, and lineage for control and dependency safeguards.

Every opportunity includes evidence, confidence, performance impact, savings range, and
a validation step. A materialization is never marked safe to remove from refresh cost
alone; removal requires a measured no-materialization baseline.

## Decisions
- **Keep** — observed reads justify refresh cost and cached p95 meets the target.
- **Retune** — useful, but refreshing more often than usage/source updates require.
- **Investigate** — low observed utilization, control risk, or incomplete lineage.
- **Remove candidate** — only after a measured counterfactual stays within the latency SLO.
- **Add candidate** — repeated live workload where refresh TCO is likely lower.
- **Optimize query/model** — lower the per-run floor before adding more caching.

## Intake
Configure the decision constraints in `advisor-config.json`:
1. **Latency SLO** and acceptable slowdown.
2. **Freshness requirement** (real-time disables add-materialization advice).
3. **Primary goal**: cost, latency, or performance per dollar.
4. **Minimum monthly savings** and utilization thresholds.

**$/credit is auto-detected** from `SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE` (effective rate); only
asked if that's unavailable. Persist answers in `advisor-config.json` (see
`advisor-config.example.json`) and pass `--config`.

## Quick start (CLI)
Requires Python 3.8+ (stdlib only) and the [`snow` CLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index)
with read access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE`.

```bash
# analyze (read-only)
python3 scripts/analyze.py --conn <snow-conn> --config advisor-config.json --out out

# Optional Sigma enrichment (schedules, controls, lineage)
export SIGMA_BASE_URL=https://<region-api-host>
export SIGMA_CLIENT_ID=... SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=...
python3 scripts/enrich.py --inv out/inventory.json

# report
python3 scripts/render-html.py --inv out/inventory.json --out out/report.html --customer "Acme"

# remediate (opt-in) — needs Sigma REST creds:
eval "$(/path/to/get-token.sh)"          # sets SIGMA_API_TOKEN + SIGMA_BASE_URL
python3 scripts/materialize.py list   --workbook <workbookId>                        # find the elementId
python3 scripts/materialize.py create --workbook <workbookId> --sheet <elementId> --cron "0 0 * * *" --dry-run
python3 scripts/materialize.py run    --workbook <workbookId> --sheet <elementId>    # refresh + poll
python3 scripts/materialize.py delete --workbook <workbookId> --sheet <elementId>    # destructive, confirms unless --yes
```

## Running in Snowflake / Cortex Code
The cost analysis is portable SQL — no external CLI needed, and the data never leaves the
account:

1. Run the four files in `sql/`, setting their `days`, `org`, and `min_runs` variables.
2. Export the result sets into one JSON bundle:
   `{"workload":[],"coverage":[],"materializations":[],"warehouses":[]}`.
3. Render the bundle:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/analyze.py --from-rows bundle.json --goal performance_per_dollar --out out
   python3 scripts/render-html.py --inv out/inventory.json --out out/report.html --customer "Acme"
   ```

The heavy lifting stays in-warehouse while Sigma enrichment runs only where REST access
is available.

## Scripts
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/analyze.py` | cost/performance evidence → v2 inventory + Markdown report |
| `scripts/cost_model.py` | pure keep/retune/investigate/remove/add decision engine |
| `scripts/enrich.py` | read-only Sigma schedule/control/lineage enrichment |
| `scripts/materialize.py` | explicit schedule CRUD and refresh actions (`--dry-run`) |
| `scripts/render-html.py` | `inventory.json` → customer-facing `report.html` |
| `sql/*.sql` | workload, coverage, materialization ROI, and warehouse context |
| `example/make-sample.py` | regenerate the synthetic example |

## Privacy & safety
Analysis (`analyze.py`, `enrich.py`, `render-html.py`) is read-only by construction.
Remediation is explicit and opt-in: `materialize.py create` / `update` / `delete` manage
a schedule's cron cadence and `materialize.py run` triggers an on-demand refresh — all four
only act when you invoke them with a specific `--sheet`/`--workbook`/`--datamodel`.
`delete` is destructive (cancels all future runs, no undo) and prompts for confirmation
unless you pass `--yes`. See [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md). The committed
[`example/`](example/) is **fully synthetic** (fictional "Northwind Trading Co.") — no real
data. Real outputs are customer-confidential; `.gitignore` keeps `*-out/` and creds out of
git.
